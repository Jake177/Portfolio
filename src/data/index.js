export const aboutText = `Hi, I’m Jianhui Ling, but you can call me James. 
I recently completed my Master of Information Technology at Monash University, 
where I also earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I’m passionate about building scalable, 
high-performance digital solutions and have hands-on experience across full-stack development, cloud architecture,
 and DevOps practices. In my recent projects, I’ve designed and developed web applications using Vue.js, React, and Node.js, 
 and deployed them on AWS using automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, PM2, and Nginx — reducing deployment time from 10 minutes 
 to just 2 minutes. I’ve also worked on a serverless image recognition system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB that 
 supported over 100 concurrent users and cut storage costs by 40%. I thrive in collaborative Agile environments and 
 enjoy working with cross-functional, cross-cultural teams. I value clear communication, problem-solving, and user-focused 
 thinking, and I’m always eager to learn new technologies. For me, development isn’t just about writing code — it’s about
  turning real-world challenges into meaningful digital solutions.`
